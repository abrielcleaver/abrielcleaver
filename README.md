As a software developer with a Master of Science in Mental Health & Wellness, I thrive when it comes to deconstructing an issue logically. I bring a variety of skillsets, including photography and social media marketing. These skills give me the enhanced ability to produce clean code and well-written documentation with close attention to detail.

I enjoy learning new technologies and working with diverse teams. 
I am happiest when I get to work on a team that is passionate about our project!
